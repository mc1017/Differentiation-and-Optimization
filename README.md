# MML Coursework 1 - Differentiation and Optimization
All of the content for this coursework is contained in the provided Jupyter notebook.

The ./tests folder is only required if you wish to carry out the assignment on google colab - in this case you will need to mount the notebook onto googledrive, and place the ./tests in the same working directory as the notebook. If you are working in VSCode or Juypter/Jupyter Lab, this is not necessary, as the tests are embedded into the notebook.
